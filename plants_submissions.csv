-How long do the flowers last and how long does the foliage/leaves last?
-what do I do with it once there's only a bulb left?
-Can hyacinths live in a container forever, or do I need to plant them in my garden? 
-When do I plant them? It's winter here with temperatures below 0C. Should I wait for the foliage to die and only plant the bulb, or should I plant right now? 
-What's the best spot for planting? Direct sun or indirect sun? 
-How do I water them? There's a bulb so should I water them right now (obviously when the soil is dry) or does the bulb have enough water and nutrients stored? 
-How do I take care of them if I plant them in my garden?

this is what i presume to be a ficus Benjamina. I got it about 3 years ago and it stopped growing relatively quickly. 
So today I decided to repot it and give it some nice well draining new soil and hope to regain some growth. 
To my surprise my presumption, its stunted growth  was due to the roots being too much for the pot, was completely wrong. Instead the roots are very short and intertwined extremely. The also start rather thick but get skinny really quickly and maybe managed to go halfway down the previous pot. 
Now I’m not sure what it’s issue was. 
Can it just not grow any bigger since it looks happy otherwise? Should I try and separated the small trees into several bunches and just accept that some roots will break?
Very happy about any help, I have never had this plant before and am really confused :/",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1agrli6

No visible eggs but they grow in the soil. I haven't been over watering as I know this can contribute to the problem. I spray with bug killer & use sticky fly catchers. 

What else can I do?! They keep flying around the house which is irritating & gross. 

Do I need to replant each plant with fresh soil or should I put all plants in one room, and shut the door with a plug-in device to kill the flies?

I have bought a growlight to cope with the sunlight issue, and i took the risk of repotting it during winter to a much more welldrained soil. However, my question is, what are the possible outcomes of a soil that is too well drained and contains not enough soil to contribute with nutrition?

As the picture shows, i now have a mix of soil, pinebark, coco coir and perlite, see picture.

It threw off the big leafs within a week because it apparently was overwatered. 
I bought it 17 days ago and did not water it in the first week because it was freshly watered at the plantstore the day I bought it. 


I then repotted it (it had one tiny baby leaf left) into new soil because the old one had rotten roots and was soaking wet.
Now the last little leaf is gone too after it was perfect just yesterday. 


I carefully cleaned the leftovers and the last two pictures are the result. It seems like it has one big good root left and one very small.( the long thing pointing up is the rest of a stem) Can it grow back from just that? And what do I have to do to help her as good as possible?  I know it will probably take a while but I want to try! 


I am New to having plants.


Right now I have the leftovers wrapped in a wet paper towel and placed in a clear airtight container. (Picture 4)

Hello lovely botanists!

Meet my Auntie Betty. Well, not actually my Auntie Betty, her Aloe Vera. But I've called her Auntie Betty in tribute.

My Auntie passed away last month aged 96 after one hell of a life, mostly fueled by spite and hate wrapped in an exterior of Posh British Old Lady. She was a terror to most, but very loyal to those very few she did like, including myself. It was an expected and not-actually-too-sad-by-the-end death, as she'd been ready to go for a while and yet she clung on long enough so that she could see in the New Year and yet early enough to take the honour of being first to die in her Care Home (newly built, very nice, they were wonderful with her). It's how she would have wanted to go - peaceful, out of it, and beating everyone to an arbitrary goal they didn't even know they were competing for. 

My Mum, my sister and myself went to clear out some things from her old house today, and one of the things I came away with (including a bible and a tacky hair slide/comb thing which she had bequeathed to me for some reason while we wait for the will to cash out - she was going a bit weird in the latter years, bless her) was the pictured Aloe Vera, which has sat on her window sill in indirect sunlight for a number of years, and which none of us know anything about caring for and I don't think she did either. She was likely a gift from someone and her namesake never threw anything away (seriously, the woman was a very organised hoarder, I'm surprised there wasn't a date and detailed description of where she came from on the plant pot, everything else seemed to have that). I don't even know if she is healthy, I just felt bad that she was going to be chucked out otherwise (despite my slightly disrespectful write up above, I did like my Auntie Betty, even though she could be a right cow most of the time, so it's nice to have something of hers live on. Wherever she ended up she'll be shouting at whoever is in charge and getting everything up to her idea of code and tbh I gotta respect that and want that Boss Bitch energy in my house). 

Anyhoo - Reddit, what do I do to care for / rescue if needed this lovely plant? She's bending to one side, is very pale, and I think has had babies (out of wedlock, Auntie Betty would be very scathing).  Also bonus, I have an Aloe Vera which has been sat in my bathroom for a few months after rescuing that from somewhere too, so any tips on that (as yet unnamed) guy would be appreciated as well because I don't know if he's healthy either.

I'm bad at replying to comments as I will now walk away and forget about having posted, so thank you in advance for any advice!

I have an 8-year old avocado tree in a pot indoors and I’ve been struggling with it for the past 2 years. It has had fungus gnats and most recently scale bugs.

I have been spraying the plant with a natural insecticide mixed with some alcohol and have been removed scaled bugs with a Q-tip. 

The plants branches are slowly turning black and all of the new growth is dying and withering away. It is also winter and a lot of ants are indoors and I know they farm the scale bugs. There aren’t many scale bugs on the plant since I’m monitoring it. I’m not sure if the gnats are causing this. I repotted the plant less that a year ago to get rid of old soil. I haven’t tried cinnamon in the soil but I did get a carnivorous plant that put in a lot of work.

I was confused, but eventually the rot got so bad the plant had to go. 

Then, in late December, I bought a philodendron glorious. I took her out of her dense mix and into a chunky mix, with a moss pole. I haven't watered her since December 28th 2023, and I looked at the soil and it was wet. The roots weren't growing either. I took her out, examine the roots, and noticed that the same exact thing happened. She's under a strong grow light as well. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong? Is it because of the moss poles? I make sure to water them, but not enough that it gets the soil damp. I just want to have some lush big climbing philodendrons. 

Any advice? Pic of my glorious below.",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1aj4gyg/plants_rot_when_put_on_a_moss_pole/

i did accidentally knock it over a few weeks ago, but picked it right back up and made sure it didn’t lose too much soil. i was going to try repotting it but it’s not quite spring time yet and i’m not sure if it’ll survive repotting while losing its leaves at a rapid rate. the trunk seems sturdy and there aren’t any pests.

I will be planting some rooted cuttings back into this soil and am afraid that these cuttings with the small roots will be competing for water and nutrients with the longer roots.

I'm fairly certain this is me not watering them enough. I just want to take better care of this one since I'm being given another go. How often should I water them? I always seem to forget ab them since my snake plants can seemingly go forever without. I'm wanting to repot it with some fresh soil, but I'm thinking I should wait til it warms up more or will it matter if the plant is indoors?

I also read somewhere if you line the bottom of your pot with some rocks and then add your dirt and plant, you can leave water in the drip pan and the plant can have a damp enviroment close by inbetween watering. Is this true?

I also keep it out of direct sunlight, I remember reading that somewhere. But it does get a couple hours a day of indirect light in my living room with the curtains open

One thought I had was bamboo but it doesn't look like bamboo... nor does it seem to be shooting up like bamboo... just growing across my yard near the surface... I can't tell if it is thicker in one direction or another enough to tell which neighbor might be growing the plant itself either... but the root itself seems healthy... I just don't trust it.

Anyone have an idea what it might be?

I'm in south-central Texas if that helps. I did Google some invasive plants to my area but I'm struggling to come up with anything substantial. Any help is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1ajnyfj/questions/

I would appreciate any and all advice on any sites or resources I could use to identify plants that would look good for this purpose, that aren’t easy to kill, that can survive and thrive in intense sunlight (we have a west facing condo), and that can survive in USA Georgia weather. If any plants that would be great come to mind, I’ll take that advice too! Preferably plants that aren’t toxic to cats — we have a cat who is not allowed on the balcony sans supervision but who sometimes sneaks out, so lilies are a no go, for example, as they would kill him since he has no survival instincts and loves to eat any plants in sight.

I hope this finds you all well. I was reviewing the Wiki on light requirements for plants. I have come to the conclusion a handful of my plants need an artificial source to make up for what is not provided by direct sunlight. The main windows in my apartment are oriented parallel to the Sun's path so during the Summer they do get decent sunlight but along with obvious reasons, the path makes it limited in the winter. Concurrently, I think even in the summer some of the plants could use help as the direct sunlight is only for a short period of time.

It chewed down leaves of some spider plants and pothos as well as baby plants waiting to be propagated. 

This not the first time. My roommate and I have had some strained conversations about this before and we’ve gotten better with our conflict resolution, but I’m beginning to lose patience again. Roommates general logic tend to be, “Well, it’s a cat. He’s going to chew things dangle off,” as if it’s not THEIR cat (something I don’t have control over) destroying MY plants (something I nurture and care about). Roommate doesn’t say something this crass anymore, but I can tell they’re probably just as frustrated because it seems to be that it’s just a naughty cat.

I was looking to buy my girlfriend a Calathea Lancefolia since she always talks about getting one but decided for a different plant each time we are at the store.

She's a very involved with houseplants and we got like 50 of them in our apartment since it's her hobby but I myself have no clue about plants other than me liking the aesthetic.

I sneakily asked her what she checks for when buying new plants at the store and this checklist is what I remember her talking about. 

Is there anything crucial in that checklist missing that I should look out for when choosing the calathea?

Thanks in advance!",https://i.redd.it/gmgulekfp1hc1.jpeg

So I’ll make this quick. My dad is the viral sensation “Man Eating Food” and we’ve gotten great laughs about this over the past few years. 

The fact is, he just retired as a special needs teacher with over 20+ years in education. He’s done incredible things for so many people and as fun as “Man Eating Food” was he didn’t make 5 digits of profit. His pension isn’t enough to cover the bills so he got another job after retiring. 

The incredible thing is, he’s an inventor, a designer and lover of plants!! 🌱 

He designed a plant lamp called “Touch My Plant”
In which you touch the plant to turn the lights on and off. 

He loves making these plant lamps and dreams of starting a small business where he can employ special needs workers to wire electrically. Sales are slow though and I decided it’s time I take over for him.

He’s a funny guy everyone, and he loved plants, and is a genuinely good man. Any chance you can help me spread the word???",https://www.touchplantlamp.com

So I am trying to  find an automatic watering system to water my indoor herbs (mostly  basil), with a consistent and regular quantity since I keep failing at  it myself ...  I am not trying to go for something super fancy but more  like a simple system that I would just have to fill water in a tank and  that would drip a bit of water slowly every day for instance.

I  have been browsing various devices online but I am not sure if I should  go for something fully automated like on the picture, or if a classic plastic self-watering spikes system would make the job, I used to use it on holidays but not sure if it would work on a consistent basis. Although I think something with a single tank to fill would be much more convenient rather than filling multiples ater bottle every week. 

Would love to have some feedback on  your experience with this kind of devices if you tried/use something  similar, and maybe some suggestions ?

My budget was maybe something < 50e if possible! Thanks :)

Short story: I bought a few succulents a few weeks ago and they’ve been doing well. Then I decided to go with my girlfriend to look for a slightly bigger plant for my bookcase. After walking around for a bit, we stumbled across the calathea medallion that I currently own. I was just captivated by the foliage. It was the right size and looked amazing so I bought it. I bought it without doing any prior research and here we are :3 End of story.

I have had it for about a week now. I have watered it only once deeply with distilled water. I poured it from the top of the soil until I saw the water come out of the bottom. Then I let it drain for a little while and put it into a slightly bigger pot. So far I have been spraying some water on it every other night, and have been bringing it into the bathroom with me when I shower to give it humidity (idk if that’s dumb, I’m just trying to keep it alive). It sits in my room where it would get a medium amount of indirect sunlight normally, but it’s been really cloudy and rainy recently so the amount of sunlight it has been receiving is probably less than ideal. There are a few brown spots and dark looking spots on the leaves and towards the edges, and I’m unsure if the roots look healthy.

Please take a look at the pictures and let me know if it looks okay?? (Excuse the poor picture quality) I am trying to be very committed to taking care of my plants. I would really appreciate any advice on how to care for my calathea!",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1an6pn8

Both look unhappy. The top one is losing its bigger leaves. The monstera has a couple leaves lower down that are going yellow. Both otherwise look healthy and are growing a bit.

Is it a lack of light, or something else I've done?

They get watered occasionally but I let the soil go dry first. Right now the soil is just moist to the touch.

If it's a lack of light, can I use a more standard light to help them out, rather than a harsh grow light? These are in a bedroom.

I had an old pot filled with dirt, made a little hole in the middle, and stuck the bottom inch or so of the onion into the dirt. Within a week or so it had grown roots to the point that it was entirely rooted and would not come loose, and the green sprouts on the top half had grown quite long already too!

But then I read you are supposed to separate each sprout, so I dug it out. It had already grown roots down to the bottom of the pot and throughout the dirt. I was able to peel all the bad layers that were soggy and hollow off but was unable to keep going as I was afraid I'd damage it. I replanted it with all the sprouts still within, but the few layers surrounding them were nice and crisp and smelled strongly of onion. I will continue to water and give lots of sunshine. 

Question: Does anyone know what exactly I'll be growing since the bulbs (sprouts) are still together though?? Will my taking it out of the dirt (and ripping a few of the roots that were deeper down), or the removal of further layers, or replanting hurt or kill it potentially? I read that if the sprouts aren't separated before planting they will compete, and read elsewhere that planting the entire onion would only produce further sprouts (green onions). Any information and help is much appreciated. Thanks everyone!

We had a happy blooming orchid for several years. After one shock where we kept it in water way too long the orchid lost majority of leaves, roots and stem. Now, it’s been like on the picture for several months and it only gets worse. I was hopeful until the roots had the green tip but that’s gone now. 

We kept it on the same spot next to northern window (I am from centr Europe). No direct sunlight. Fertilized gently. Then it started to go brown and dry (no rotting wierdly). I cut all the dead stuff and it’s like this ever since. Small change is that as soon as small leaf appears the largest one is already dying. I try not to water much because the roots get darker after being at just water so I spray it instead - lightly once a week. Room temperature varies 17-22 average is 20

I have one more orchid that is in the same state.

I’m tired of spending $100+ on plants that die because they don’t get watered. Because of the history of the house and where it’s located my husband refuses to put fake flowers in. 

What can I put in that’s bright, full sun, heat and low water tolerant that won’t die in a week? I’m in the northeast",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1ao6g4b/window_boxes/

Found the little fkr's yesterday. Sprayed down all my plants with Safer's end all and left them in the bathroom overnight. Today, I took everyone out of its pot, rinsed and treated the roots with diluted peroxide and will be replanting most of them. I think I will leave the MASSIVE collection of pothos in water for the time being. Of course not in the tub lol but in containers. My thought is that thrips can't leave eggs in soil if there is no soil.  I am also sterilizing all the pots. This has been HOURS of work but I LOVE my plants and sadly my ignorance means I have failed them :(   


I would have used a systemic treatment but in Canada they are not allowed so this is the plan I came up with. I hope my babies survive but given how bad this got (sigh, learning as I go) I decided that I was going to respond aggressively. If nothing else I will gain knowledge from this. Ahhh pests, how I hate you.   


Last year it was a 4 month battle with gnats and I am not up for that this year so I used the ""nuclear"" option. I am hoping that they make it but given how many thrips I saw on the tops of the leaves this morning after treating the plants, I can only assume that the soil was a thrip nursery.   


Wondering if I should cut EVERY leaf off my monstera, every one has damage or colour loss. Any advice moving forward would be greatly appreciated.   


I'm including some pics. Lol if I have made a poor treatment choice please be kind :)

As you can see, they’re by the window on the ground floor of my house facing the garden.

I’ve watered every now and then when the soil looks dry and more recently once seeing the flowers decline. I don’t see any bugs.

Our most recent pickup was the Dracaena Reflexa, and we’re a little torn on where will be best for it as I’ve read once it has a spot it likes, it won’t want to be moved. I’m having a hard time discerning which areas are considered “bright indirect” and “low light”, specifically in the corner of the living room. No indoor lights are on for either of these photos. 

The current spot it’s sitting can be seen in the first picture; this would be the living area. These are all south facing windows (our covered patio is on the other side of them) and you can see some afternoon/evening light is getting in and hitting the media console around 4:30pm when the photo was taken. We're in Texas also, if that helps.

I guess my question would be: does the current spot for the Reflexa constitute bright indirect light even with the covered patio outside? Would the dining area be better for it, maybe next to the lemon tree?  My understanding would be that the Corn Plant is sitting in ""bright indirect"" even with the covered patio blocking some of the sun's access into the living area, but I'm not entirely sure. The low height of the Reflexa currently means it does receive some direct light, specifically towards the end of the day. 

Also, would our plant shelf's location be considered bright indirect light? During the mornings and day a lot of light is able to come in through the back door and dining area window, so we've been under the assumption the shelf is in bright indirect light throughout the day. Some of the lower shelves probably receive a bit of direct light during the day also, but this doesn't seem to upset the plants.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1aol1mu

-Rose loves warmth and sunlight, perhaps partial shade, but if the rose still glows for about 5-6 hours a day. What does the shadow mean? Flowering may stop, dark spots appear on the leaves, and blind shoots occur.
-The place should be well ventilated, but sheltered from northern winds.
-There are no roses from above the landscape. Roses need to lift any soil, with the exception of clay and light sandy loam inclusions. Such lands can be adjusted: to a loamy addition of sand (3 parts), turf, humus, compost (1 part each); into the sandy loam bedding, finely ground turf soil (2 parts each), compost or humus (1 part).
-Too dense planting provokes the development of fungal diseases, both in rainy times and in drought.

If the place you choose does not create favorable conditions, this does not mean that they will die. Most likely, the roses will have uncharacteristic growth for the varieties, the flowering will not be as lush,",https://i.redd.it/eki4puu6k1ic1.jpeg

I have some options here;

1. just add more soil (as i was initially planning to do) and maybe add moss or rocks on the top

2. i cut the plant so it could grow new leaves that start at the bottom. Thought about doing this but it made me hesitant

I assumed they were spider mites, but there was never a sign of webs, so I guess they could have been aphids or thrips? I couldn’t figure out why the plant wouldn’t sustain more than one leaf at a time until I spotted this infestation (and this has been going on since October). Instead of being smart and taking a pic or a video, I freaked out and yeeted that pot to the next county. However, I did pull the leaf, with a wonderful root ball. I rinsed it off, and sprayed it entirely with Neem oil last night, and an alcohol, water, and soap mixture today. It is now in a glass with water and a tiny amount of plant food. I’ve checked my other plants and don’t see anything anywhere on them, but I sprayed them with Neem oil last night and the alcohol mixture today. My question is, can I feel safe that since I was able to pull the plant entirely from dirt that we’re safe? I’ve held it up to the light to see if I can see anything within the leaf itself and I don’t, but I’m not sure if that’s actually possible.

I wish I could be more helpful in what they were, but at the time I was more concerned about them eating my flesh. I did first notice them after briefly touching the plant and then touching my phone and seeing these small whitish things w multiple legs, but idk if there were 6 or 8 legs, and I have no idea how I didn’t notice it until it was this bad.

u/Salty-Alternate,The Dancing Bones that wasnt...,1,2024-02-13 12:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1aq44oe/the_dancing_bones_that_wasnt/,"So, once upon a time a couple of years ago, I bought a little bitty dancing bones cactus at the plant shop.   She's several feet tall now and I've propagated her 4 times.  Today, as I was watering her, I noticed a white substance at the joints of her 'leaves' and was worried she had an illness, I rubbed some of it between my fingers and it was sticky.  I googled about it only to see that what the plant store had labeled as a dancing bones cactus, was actually a pencil cactus!  A pencil cactus happens to produce quite toxic sap that can have a severe reaction to skin, eyes, and GI tract and the internet is all like 'wear gloves while handling!'

Meanwhile, I bought the dancing bones plant specifically because I read that they were nontoxic, because I have pets. So I've just been super lucky the past few years I guess that my pets never took an interest and also that SOMEHOW when I propagated, pruned, and re-potted this thing, I haven't had a reaction. 

I never noticed the white sap before today, though, and I did literally smoosh some of it between my fingers, 20 minutes ago.  So I guess I'll keep those fingers crossed that this isn't my unlucky day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1aq44oe/the_dancing_bones_that_wasnt/

My father bought me this flytrap. I tried to do research but I don't know about reliable sources?

From what I've seen, it does good with bottom watering and needs distilled/rain water, NO tap or bottled water, and lots and lots of intense light. 
I have it in this case to keep it wet(?), and have it in a plastic cup of rainwater, bottom watering. It's still in the nursery pot.
I'm doing research on a terrarium-- porous rocks, then with sand, peat, moss, perlite? 

This is more or less to check my facts because I'm so worried I'm gonna kill the little lady. I've named her Veronique.

I brought it home (in a closed bag to not be exposed to the cold) and now I’m curious what can I do to nurse it and give it a chance to heal and sprout. 

These pictures were taken today, the cut looks pretty moist and I can see some black spots (fungus?) developing on the sides. I also added a photos of the soil (she said it was watered yesterday morning and she watered it about once every 3-4 days). 

I placed it in a very well lit closed balcony with temperatures of at least 14 Celsius/ 57 Fahrenheit.

I inherited her inherited plant, so it’s easily over 2 decades old. I’m not sure how long the plant had been here before her, but all the older guys say the plant has been here forever (forever seems to start in the 80’s around here). 

In fairness, this plant was not in good shape to start. It hasn’t been repotted in I have no idea how long. It’s grown much taller than it should’ve due to not getting any light. One of the first things I did was at least move it to a window. On top of all that, it went about 3 months without being watered while my predecessor was out on medical leave. So by the time I got it, it was half dead and burnt to a crisp. 

Since then, I think I overwatered it badly one time as I saw yellowing but it was floppy or if it was a stem it’s be yellow and squishy. So I stopped watering it as frequently. I came in after the weekend and it’s just laying on its side. Is there a way to save this or is it too far gone? I feel terrible for killing it so fast, but I don’t have a green thumb and this was my first fear when she gave it to me.

Sorry I don’t remember the name of the plant, I asked my sister when I first got it and she was the one who told me it was growing weird and tall. I forgot what she said though.",https://i.redd.it/7q9yu3n91kic1.jpeg

Nice healthy roots. I was actually surprised. I took out as much of the wet soil as I could but left some intact just around the rootball so not to shock the roots/plant so much, that dirt was still quite moist. Not a significant amount of dirt.

Propagating cuttings is probably the thing I enjoy most. 

**Tradescantia cuttings couldn't be easier to propagate. They root readily in water. They continue to do just fine after being potted up in their first small pot.**

**My problems seem to come when it's time to move them on to a bigger pot. They seem to do okay for a month or so, before inevitably declining in health. The leaves start dying, and despite my best efforts, the plant itself inevitably dies.**

I don't think I'm potting them on too soon, judging by how quickly they grow. My guess is that I'm not scaling their watering needs correctly. I've tried watering less, and watering more (up to the tranditional: letting the top few inches of soil dry out between watering), and they still die.

They're a fast growing plant, so maybe they just need their watering significantly scaled up as their pot size increases? I don't know but, **I'd appreciate some help on this one.**

I’ve been trying to grow basil indoors as a little herb garden and every time the basil ends up wilting and dieing.

Beneficial nematodes and 2. Yellow sticky traps to stop the circle of life of these peaky critters. This was highly successful for me, and now everytime I start to see more fungus gnats after a few months I just re-water my plants with beneficial Nematodes and they continue to go away!

Did you know that some of the vegetables we consume daily can be found in the wild? Our planets diverse ecosystem is teeming with vibrant life and amongst this life we find an array of wild vegetables. These vegetables often overlook grow unaided by human hands, flourishing under the nurturing care of Mother Nature herself. They need no pesticides, no fertilizers and no artificial chemicals. 

From the humble pumpkin, a member of the Cucurbitaceae family, to the versatile corn whose origins can be traced back to a wild grass known as Teo cinti. From the sturdy onion, a root vegetable native to Asia, to the ubiquitous potato, a staple in many diets worldwide. And not forgetting the sea vegetables, our oceans Unique contribution to the vegetable Kingdom. That these are just a few examples of the wild vegetables that we'll be exploring, so. Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the wild world of vegetables. Starting off our journey, we encounter 2 familiar faces, pumpkins and corn. Pumpkins, along with their Cucurbitaceae family members, have a fascinating history tracing their roots back to the Americas. Their journey began somewhere between 7000 and 5500, years before Christ. These robust fruits, often mistaken for vegetables, have evolved naturally. And expanded their reach from the Americas to Europe and other continents. Pumpkins are loved not just for their nutritional benefits, but also for their ornamental and recreational uses, especially around Halloween. Let's turn our attention now to corn, a staple in many diets around the world. The ancestor of modern corn used to resemble a pine cone. This wild grass, known as maize or teosinte, was domesticated over 10,000 years ago. According to local lore, it was Mexicans from the Tagawa Akan Valley who first domesticated. This wild grass. Through their efforts, they were able to produce multiple cobbs, leading to the development of the corn we know and enjoy today. Corn has since become a versatile food, enjoyed grilled, boiled or even popped into a tasty snack. Both pumpkins and corn have adapted and evolved over thousands of years, displaying nature's incredible capacity for change. They serve as a testament to the symbiotic relationship between humans and the natural world, a relationship that has shaped our diets, our cultures and our landscapes. So next time you carve a pumpkin or enjoy a corn on the cob, remember their wild roots. These everyday items on our dinner tables have a rich history and have journeyed far and wide to region. They remind us that even the most common foods have a wild side, the side that connects us to our past and to the natural world around us, moving on to our next set of wild vegetables. Rice and onions. Let's begin with rice, a staple food for more than half of the world's population. Originally derived from a wild grass known as ariza roofie, pogan rice has come a long way from its wild origins, although the term wild rice is commonly used to refer to species that belong to the genera Zizania. In Puerto Ricia, it's also app for Orisa species that remain wild or have never been farmed. Overtime, this wild grass has been cultivated and refined, giving us the countless varieties of rice we enjoy today. Rice is not just a source of sustenance, it's a symbol of life and fertility often used in rituals and celebrations. It's a testament to our ability to harness the wild and adapt it to our needs. Isn't it fascinating to think that every time we cook rice, we're participating in a tradition that dates back thousands of years? Now let's turn our attention to onions, a vegetable that's as versatile as it is flavorful. Wild onions native to Asia were among the first foods that our ancestors found and ate. Before the advent of farming or even riding, these pungent bulbs were being consumed, probably for their ability to add flavor to what was otherwise a bland diet. Some studies suggest that onions were first cultivated in Iran and West Pakistan. Onions are not just a kitchen staple, they're also packed with nutrients. They're a good source of vitamin C, can boost heart health and have been used in traditional medicines for centuries. Onions also have a unique place in history and culture. They were revered by the ancient Egyptians. Used as currency in the Middle Ages and are still a symbol of prosperity in some cultures. So the next time you enjoy a bowl of rice or use onions in your cooking. Remember that these vegetables have a wild side too. They're not just ingredients. They're linked to our past, a testament to our ingenuity and a reminder of nature's bounty. Venturing further into the wild, we find potatoes in a variety of sea vegetables. Potatoes, a staple in many diets around the globe, trace their roots back to the Americas. These tuberous vegetables were discovered around 12,000 years ago by a species in the Solanum Brevital group. Some relatives of the potato are still farmed in the Andes region of South America, where the plant is native. High in fiber and nutrients, potatoes are a versatile food source, though they do contain sugar and calories. Now let's dive into the ocean for a completely different type of wild vegetable sea vegetables. These aren't your typical garden variety. They're a type of algae harvested straight from the ocean. Kelp, for example, is a large brown algae that forms thick underwater forests near the shore. Salicornia, on the other hand, thrives in salty coastal marshes. Boasting succulent spreading stalks that resemble thick grass. Another sea vegetable, dosa is a type of red algae with lush lettuce like fronds. It's often used in salads and side dishes. Nori, a familiar sight to sushi lovers, is also a type of red algae widely used in Japanese cuisine. Irish Moss, another red algae, goes by the name Chondrus crispus in the Northern Atlantic, and Ukuma Topsis is a formis in the Caribbean. Both contain carrageenan which cooks into a Jelly like substance see pursuing A flowering succulent similar to see beans is found in sand and salt marshes worldwide. Native Floridians have been known to eat it raw, boiled or pickled, while in the Philippines it's known as atura. So whether you're eating a potato or using sea vegetables in your dishes, remember the wild origins of these versatile vegetables. Their natural roots remind us of the bounty that nature offers. And the ways in which our diets have evolved over thousands of years to incorporate these diverse and nutritious foods. Last but not least, we have mushrooms, ginger and turmeric. These three may seem like an odd grouping, but they're united by their wild origins and their powerful health benefits, starting with mushrooms. These fascinating fungi are not technically vegetables, but they're typically grouped with them for culinary purposes. Mushrooms come in a staggering variety of shapes and sizes. The most common type you'll find in your supermarket is the white button mushroom. But the wild offers a kaleidoscope of other varieties, like the Hardy shiitake, the delicate oyster, and the robust Portobello. Each of these mushrooms has its own unique flavor profile and health benefits. Rich in antioxidants and vitamins, mushrooms are a great way to boost your immune system and overall health. Next, we have ginger. This spicy root has been used in cooking and traditional medicine for thousands of years. Originating in Southeast Asia, ginger is now found all over the world. From adding a kick to your meals to soothing a sore throat, ginger is a versatile addition to your pantry. It's also packed with antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a potent ally in the fight against various diseases. Finally, we have turmeric. This golden spice is a close relative of ginger and shares many of its health benefits. Originating from India and Southeast Asia, turmeric is now cultivated worldwide. It's a staple ingredient in many Asian cuisines, giving dishes a vibrant color and a distinctive earthy flavor. But turmeric is more than just a spice. It's been used in traditional medicine for centuries thanks to its high content of curcumin, a compound with powerful anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Whether you're adding mushrooms to your pizza, ginger to your tea, or turmeric to your Curry, you're utilizing the power of wild vegetables. They not only elevate your meals with their unique flavors. But also nourish your body with their incredible health benefits. So next time you're in the kitchen, why not try adding a touch of the wild to your dishes? We've journeyed through the wild world of vegetables today, discovering the untamed origins of some of our favorite foods. We've delved into the humble beginnings of pumpkins and corn, traced back to their early roots in the Americas. We've uncovered the wild ancestry of rice and onions native to Asia and the historic cultivation of potatoes. Our voyage took us to the depths of the ocean, exploring the variety of sea vegetables from kelp to sea per slain. The Thrive beneath the waves. We've also learned about the diverse world of mushrooms and the medicinal wonders of ginger and turmeric. Each vegetable we've encountered today has its own unique story, a testament to the resilience of nature and the fascinating evolution of our food. So the next time you enjoy these vegetables, remember their wild origins and the incredible journey they've taken to end up on your plate.",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1asnw2k/what_vegetables_can_be_found_in_the_wild/

Unfortunately I don’t have any visual aids for you so we’re gonna have to make do with a colorful description. I moved into a new flat a few months ago and the previous tenants left me an aloe plant they didn’t want anymore so I decided to be its mother. I’ve watered it super sparingly and appearance wise it looked pretty normal. The leaves however were getting very large and it was starting to tip. My friend kindly informed I needed to trim it as aloe is intended to be harvested and used or repot it (I am not a plant person and have little experience with keeping them unfortunately). So I trimmed off the longer bits and all of a sudden it is oozing a bunch and I mean a BUNCH of orange liquid, this stuff got absolutely everywhere my carpet my counters me and oh my word, oh my holy god, the smell. I don’t even have a comparison you could go off it was the most unique and foul thing I’ve ever experienced. So my question mostly is, first of all wtf was that and second will I ever stop smelling? Will my house? Do I have to move now? I’ve looked it up and the closest answer I could find is what’s called aloe latex but that’s described as a small amount of yellow slightly malodorous liquid when trimming.

I was also planning on putting some other plants in front of this window, but maybe not, I guess… At night, would it be ok to slightly open the window and keep the blinds closed, with the strelitzia right next to it?

The outdoor temperature is 5° (41F). Usually, my bedroom temp is 23° (73F) and when keeping this window open at night, it drops to 19° (66F) in the morning. I don’t really know what to do. My bf absolutely wants to keep the window open to “promote good sleep” (and while he’s right, let’s not do that during winter 🥲). I, on the other hand, I really wanted to use this only sun spot in my home to give sunlight to my plants (cause all of them are living in the shade right now).

Anyway, what would you guys do? Do you keep plants near open windows?

I moved a few years ago to a new place and my old houseplants had a lot of trouble adapting to the conditions in my appartment and sadly passed away (RIP fittonia you are missed).

To sum it up, the insulation is non-existent so temperatures range from 39C° (102F°) in the summer to 11C° (51.8F°) in the winter. I only have one small window and my staircase that provide an alright amount of light to the downstairs area (upstairs is thankfully flooded with light thanks to floor to ceiling windows so I relocated my aloes there, they are fine!). 

I'm looking for houseplants that could resist these very harsh conditions. The place runs pretty dry, so plants who need ambiant moisture won't be able to handle it. The only ones who have been able to thrive living downstairs are my english ivy (which would survive a nuclear fallout I'm sure) and a water plant.

Any suggestions? I was thinking of Pothos or maybe a fern, but I'm open to any ideas!

Thank you so much and have a lovely day",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1at4n68/houseplants_suggestions_for_extreme_conditions/

It's supposed to be very easy to maintain and require very little watering (that’s what the previous owner told us). We tried watering it every 3-4 weeks or as soon as the leaves would hang as low as in this picture. We would water it only a little bit (maybe around 200-250ml of water), however evrytime we water it it starts losing leaves. Drops at least two leaves and then it looks fresh again with leaves pointing up. Now the leaves are hanging again and I'm afraid to water it (potentially overwater). Plus there is this weird pigmentation on one leaf and small holes on some... what should I do to keep this plant alive and help it flourish? 

Also to add: the plant has been in this position for past 2 years before we took it over. It gets direkt sun during sunny days for a few hours before noon, afterwards it's indirect light. The problem with falling leaves persists since September / October 2023 or so. Pigmentation and little holes are new, maybe the past 2 months. I think the pot doesn't have a drainage, the pot is covered in plastic bag from the inside to ensure no water comes on the wooden floor (previous tenants did this, and I'm not too good and handling plants to repot and readjust a large tree like this), perhaps this also doesn’t help either…

u/AnxiousCouple,Looking for aloe tips!,7,2024-02-18 14:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1au73nr/looking_for_aloe_tips/,"So I’ve this gal for at least 7 years (maybe longer, can’t remember!). It started as a little baby sprout. It’s about 3.5ft at widest point and maybe similar for height.

I moved from a very warm 4th floor apartment that had the perfect sunlight to a house about a year ago, so this aloe and my other plants went through some stress as I figured out where to put them and changing watering needs in the new place. 

Anywho, my main question is about support for this aloe. I repotted most recently about 8 months ago, and turn it as best I can to ensure it doesn’t lean too much, but it feels a bit too heavy/at risk of falling to the side (the pot in the dirt is my temporary “don’t fall over” effort).

Some of the lower leaves have kinked (I assume due to weight or poor care), but most are fine. Should I remove the worst of the lower ones and repot to try to seat the plant lower in the pot? I will admit the most pruning I’ve ever done is just cut any pieces that brown or badly damaged.

It’s putting out another round of pups, so it can’t be too unhappy I guess. I am open to repotting despite it being a Herculean effort due to the weight 😅).


Ignore the non-pollinated flower sprout. I just haven’t cut it yet this year. Thanks for any and all advice. I feel I’ve gotten by being a successful semi-lazy plant mom, but have started getting nervous I’ll neglect this one too much and be sad!

House is surrounded by trees. Lately, when out the front I've been getting a faint whiff of something. Garbage/sewage. Not all the time, just catching it in passing.

Today, we got a bit of a storm and my wife smelled it too.

We recentlyish, like 6 months ago, had some repairs done to where our sewer line connects to the main. My first thought was storm water getting into the line and it wasn't fixed properly and it's shifted again or something.

Did a sniff test round the dirt. It wasn't that.

But caught the smell. Wife agrees. Seems to be coming off a eucalypt.

Are we bonkers? Is there a potential chemical defense again predation the eucalypt is giving off?

It's a council tree, so will probably ask them to check it out, but it's also a council, so I don't expect them to have any clue and if they decide to act, it will be to remove the tree. I'd rather not lose a very old big ass eucalypt that has had koalas in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1aug1z8/eucalyptus_smells_sour_like_garbage_or_sewage/

I’ve never been blessed with the green thumb, but my Pothos and Monstera have been doing quite well for the last 3 years! 

I’m most pleased with my Monstera. She’s grown a lot from when I first got her - even surviving an insaneeee gnat infestation! Photo 3 is how small she was when I got her! 

But alas, as of 2-3 weeks ago, she’s been very droopy. I’ve tried to water her more. For the last couple days, I’ve pulled her out of the corner and left this curtain open so she’d get more light. There were a couple old/yellow leaves that I removed as well. 

Nothing has really changed in how I’ve cared for her so I’m not sure what’s going on! Maybe 2 months ago, I topped off the soil because it seemed low and my moss stick wasn’t well supported, but I didn’t notice that make a difference at all…

my succulent plant has some brown-ish discoloration on new leaves (or however these are called) and even at the base of older leaves (i have circled the area, it's a bit more visible irl).
is this normal? and if not, any tips?
I water it around every 20 days with a lot of water and the soil is supposed to be the right one for succulents. I also occasionally add some wet coffee to the soil, as I've heard it can help as a natural fertilizer. idk whether it actually works.

Context: A woman was poisoned by it by drinking its 'essence?' which killed her. Here are my questions:

1. What is the deadliest part of the nightshade?
2. Is BellaDonna the Latin name for Nightshade? What is the real name? What are the differences between them all (as i've read that some vegetable plants can be nightshade like tomatoes which is confusing - i want to get this right for my novel!)
3. How can one become poisoned through nightshade? I thought of drinking it as a tea maybe disguised, is that realistic?
4. What would happen to the body and mind in real life?
5. How long would it take for the effects to work? Before the drinker would ultimately die? a week, a year, straight away?
6. Would the person have to drink only one cup or would they have to drink multiple cups to die?

Other information would greatly help too.

Also, can you recommend another super deadly poisonous plant that I could use in my story instead, or is Belladonna/Nightshade already perfect enough? I need something quick-acting and potent.

From the very beginning I'd like to mention that I'm absolutely new to gardening and have 0 experience and knowledge at this field. So probably it was a quit bit compulsive decision - buying a ton of plants, but here we are 🫠
2 weeks ago I bought following plants:
1. Calathea medallion 
2. Calissia rosato aka Pink Lady 
3. Senecio rowleyanus aka Pearl string
4. Dracaena marginata (to be honest I didn't pay much attention in which condition this plant was, so the leaves that you'll see on the photo have been already like that) 
5. Mini cactus,  it might be saguaro as I can judge from the internet pictures.

During these 2 weeks I watered them once (except the cactus, it was twice, because the soil was already solid at the moment of purchase and 2 weeks after I watered it again)
And sprayed about 2-3 times on leaves.
I placed dracaena, calathea and calissia away from direct sunlight, but they have access to light, cactus and senecio are placed in semi shade, but still have few hours of sunlight.
After checking the plant's condition I noticed that something is off. Calathea's leaves started to be wavy, calissia looks dull. I'll add a few pictures of each plant.

I had my Raven ZZ outdoors when an unexpected frost came this last fall, which caused damage to some of the plant, but not all. I was able to save most of the mother plant, but I did wind up snipping another stem that was twisted (due to not being turned in the window for a while) and just not the cutest, but otherwise it was healthy and not frost damaged. I put this stem in water, along with one of my syngoniums (I've heard placing one plant with another that's happy to root helps others to root faster?) Well, weeks later after refilling the water but being pretty negligent with checking on the stems, the syngonium had rooted, and the Zz had rotted. I snipped off all of the damaged stem, made sure to get rid of all of the rot, and I'm back at square one.

 I've also tried to prop some of the leaves and smaller stems in soil, but no luck. This isn't the first time I've tried and failed to prop this zz, and I'm just wondering if there's something I'm doing wrong or if anyone else has encountered this problem. My normal zz's prop easily, so I'm stumped.

I tried experimenting a lot to see what worked and didn't work for her, but she just likes to torture me.

Context: I've had her for quite a few years now and she never really thrived, which was understandable because I got her at my local grocery store and not at a nursery.
At first I potted her up in a bad pot because it had no drainage holes + and thick soil (rookie mistake, I know).
I decided to check her out a few months ago and some of her roots were rotted.
Removed them, rinsed the healthy ones (+hydrogen peroxide) and repotted her in a higher quality aerated mix and a smaller pot to fit the amount of roots left.
Last time I checked (say a month ago???), all the roots I had were white and plump, so rot in sight.
But now she's looking like this :(
Yellowing leaves, little to no new growth, leggy as hell and over all just sad looking.
I talked to my gf about it and she told me to try and give her less light, so that was my next step, but I thought I'd post it here to get some more perspective.
I took a cut and am currently propagating it in water, just in case the mother plant dies.
After experimenting with the light, since I am now very careful when it comes to watering, my final idea was to cut her down completely, giving her a buzzcut and let her focus all her strength on now inactive nodes + new growth instead of trying to fix damaged, old growth.

This story is just a reflection of my genuine experience and I feel like I’d be doing these incredible people a disservice by not sharing it.

About a month back, during a period of personal turmoil, I was looking for something meaningful to invest my time in. I've always been in awe of people who could effortlessly grow plants and longed to bring the beauty of real plants into my home. That's when I stumbled upon Costafarms. Intrigued by their selection, I decided to order a few aloe plants, a peace lily, and a dragon tree.

However, when they arrived, my heart sank a little—the peace lily and dragon tree had suffered from the cold. Disappointed but not deterred (as the photos attached show), I reminded myself that plants, much like us, can recover from setbacks. So, I turned to Reddit's plant clinic for advice on nursing them back to health.

Imagine my surprise when Justin from Costafarms replied to my post, encouraging me to get in touch with their customer support. He assured me they'd be happy to send replacements or offer a refund. This was unexpected. In my experience, online companies rarely go out of their way unless you're vocal about your dissatisfaction. But here were Justin and Ashley from Costa, tracking down a single unhappy comment on a random subreddit to change my entire view of their company. Their effort to reach out and make things right was nothing short of amazing.

Fast forward to today, and I've just received the most beautiful replacements for the peace lily and dragon tree (as seen in the new images). If you're considering buying from Costafarms, I say go for it. Their team's dedication and kindness have truly touched me. I'm beyond grateful for how valued they made me feel through their thoughtful gesture.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1axn7aq

ZZ plant is doing well I believe.
Fatsia Japonica has stopped growing; the last leaf appeared months ago and is quite small.
Pothos stem is splitting.

I water them approximately once every two weeks when the soil isn't wet to the touch. There was a period last summer where I have to leave for four weeks and fatsia japonica lost two of the three stems.

This is my fist time posting in this subreddit; in fact, it's my first time posting at all. I actually don't use reddit all that much, but I'm desperate for any suggestions (so here I am).


For the past few weeks, I've had my eye on growing Wisteria in my home. I've bought seeds on Etsy, but so far my efforts have been in vain. I've made sure to follow the seller's directions meticulously. I've even watched YouTube videos on germinating them, but all my efforts have been in vain. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like growing from seed is a good idea for several reasons:

1. I'll be waiting 10 years for the plant to flower
2. The seeds are so expensive that I'm probably better off buying a grown plant
3. I want a specific cultivar of the Japanese wisteria plant, and by buying seeds I would never be able to confirm if they're the actual cultivar the seller says it is 
4. The seeds can always be duds, and it's a whole process to get my money back

I just really need to find a seller for the specific cultivar I want, and a seller of the whole plant/ a graft. 

I hope reddit is able to do it's magic.
Thank you to everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1ayaltf/where_to_buy_wisteria_floribunda_lawrence/

u/monsteraXcom,7 Truths About the Philodendron Whipple Way,1,2024-02-23 14:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/plants/comments/1ayefbj/7_truths_about_the_philodendron_whipple_way/," **7 Truths About the Philodendron Whipple Way**

Even plant collectors of the more common types will be fascinated by the Philodendron 'Whipple Way'. This ultra rare cultivar has dramatic features that become more pronounced by manipulation of it's environment. There appears to be a lot of misinformation out there surrounding it. Different than popular belief, this is very easy plant to care for. We'll talk about 7 truths that might be new information, or can aid to dispel any confusion.

**1. Origin**

I always like to start these with a little background. In this case, it's important to know the origins of this plant because it's both interesting but also helps to gain context on why there might be confusion on what is a *Philodendron 'Whipple Way'*. Growers by the name of Dick & Ralph, in California, cultivated this plant from a sport *Philodendron domesticum* years ago, and passed down through a tight community of niche US growers. It was named after the street they lived on.

**2. Species**

This plant is a sport *Philodendron domesticum* that was cultivated into what we know today as the Philodendron 'Whipple Way'. There are articles and older information that state it was originally produce from a *Philodendron imbe*. We can only speculate perhaps at that time, the species was thought to be this, but it is not the case.

**3. Difficulty level 0**

Contrary to popular belief and care information you'll find on the internet, they are extremely easy to care for. In fact, one of my most hardy *Philodendrons*. They do not burn easy, or require extra maintenance more than a common *Philodendron* making them an extremely desirable plant.

&#x200B;

 **4. Fast Growing**

There is also suggestion that because of their pale, white, variegated leaves, they are slow growing. This is not at true in my experience with my 3 smaller plants, and 3 larger plants all being kept them in optimal philo-environments along with other species. They out-pace most others and even during more dormant winter months, there is little slow-down.

This smaller plant pictured is a two stem plant that has doubled the amount of foliage over the course of a 4 month winter.

 **5. Green to White**

Even if you acquire a less desirable green Philodendron 'Whipple Way', blast it with light. Bonus points for sun light. You'll this will produce lighter foliage over time, eventually to the classic white.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/n89ix2za0fkc1.jpg?width=1583&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=22ee854c2f7210a5f3b32300cf28ca19a6101d1b

 **6. Light Roots**

This is not so much to dispell anything but to bring awareness to Whipple Ways having lighter roots than most other *Philodendrons*. What this means is their terrestrial roots are not thick, or heavy looking and grow slower than other similarly aged plants. It has not proven to be a deterent in my experience, and know that this is normal going into purchasing them.

**7. Authentic Whipple Ways**

Going back to the importance of origins, knowing this originally was a sport *Philodendron domesticum*, it's easy to understand why there may be confusion over plants that look similar but not quite like it. It's because those are also sport domesticum, but not cultivated to appear full white the way original line of *Philodendron 'Whipple Way'* have been.

In the illustration below you have a *Philodendron 'Whipple Way'*, and a sport *Philodendron domesticum* on the right. Many overseas growers today confuse the two, and domestic collectors who have imported them, are responsibly calling them 'Grade B' Whipple Ways. They are beautiful plants and in their own right valuable, but they are not the original Whipple Way. Also of note, since this plant was cultivated domestically in the US, it's more likely to come from a domestic grower although there are several overseas growers who have the authentic variety. It might explain the disproportional amount of availability of Grade B versus the authentic one from outside of the US.

Should I keep it inside away from the cold, while receiving little to no light (because I work during the night and sleep during the day with black curtains blocking all light).

Or should I put it on my balcony where it will receive all the light it wants, but I do not know if the cold will be a problem. I Googled that Clementines can withstand up to -6 Celcius (around 20 Fahrenheit), but this is for Clementine **trees,** and unfortunately I could not find any information concerning cold tolerance for Clementine **sprouts.**

For info, right now where I live, the coldest it gets at the moment is 3 Celcius, which is around 37 Fahrenheit.

This bad boy came with me from a tiny apartment as a little nub, can't remember who gave it to me. It's literally the first plant I ever kept alive. I planted it here 5 years ago when I bought this house. It's gone nuts after the recent rain. It's been cut back sooo many times. Thing is....I'm not thrilled with this plant. As in, no matter how well I prune it, shape it etc it's just not a look I love. My neighbour, who literally does topiaries in their yard, even did it once for me and still not into it as a lawn tree. I've decided to remove it and my neighbour is going to take it for her yard. So he will live on! But, I do want to take a few cuttings to keep in pots as I do have sentimental attachment to it and I do very much enjoy it in pots. BUT every time I've taken cuttings off it over the years, they die. I'm great with plants, shit at props. 

So... A) I've attached photos and would like some suggestions as to where cuts should/could be made. Is there a specific spot where I should be cutting? Better to use bigger branches or smaller?  B) Any helpful hints for this particular prop, apart from how to cut it, as I always kill it. Better in water or soil, heck, perlite? Watering? Remove all the leaves? Leave some on? Any special requirements like needing the soul of my first born? I mean, I can do that but just need to know....😊

My friend then presented me this plant and was like, 'hey recognize this bad boy?' 

So he gives me this plant, which at the time I kind of didn't want because it's not just any plant and I don't want to kill it. But I've had it for a year now and it's doing better than ever! Here's the thing though, he said it was a money tree but this thing keeps sprouting 7 and 8 point leaves since I've gotten it and apparently that's incredibly rare? So is it actually a money tree?

This summer I bought a small ivy plant that I've kept on a shelf inside my apartment. It's not by any windows so it doesn't get any sunlight (read that they prefer shadow?) but the room is small so it's bright during the day.

I've been watering it like every third day which has seemed enough, I've checked regularly and basically watered when it's felt dry - happened to be every third day more or less.

The plant was fine for the first few months but lately I've noticed its branches have started to wither one by one. I have no idea what to do about this, all I have done is I have started spraying it with water since we do have very dry air in the apartment wintertime. I did this once a day, then twice a day when it didn't seem to help. It is not fully withered. wtf?

The one I kept was looking healthy and green with a bunch of leaves but as winter started to come by the leaves has started to go brown and I don't know if its because of the weather because I live in Sweden so it gets pretty cold as well as very little sunlight during the days, but my mom is also very fond of plants and have done some research and she has fed it plant nutrients and magnesium or whatever it was called, but my plant is still looking pretty sad and this is like my first ever plant and though I know the chance is pretty low, it would be so much fun to see this grow throughout the years and perhaps someday grow fruits on it own.

* ﻿tree is placed indoors away from a draft -I have uv grow lights for it daily -I mist the foliage -I water thoroughly when the top layer is dry to the touch
* ﻿﻿I recently removed a top layer of soil and replaced it with fresh bonsai soil

I'm guessing it can use a prune but not sure what the best plan of action is! If anyone can give me some pointers, id greatly appreciate it!

The leaves on these plants always curl and get these weird holes in them. I've tried looking into this issue in the past, wondering if it was a watering consistency problem, and tried treating for thrips and pest. But it never seemed to be a pest problem. And recently I started wondering if it's a fungal spot disease, but again it doesn't seem right since the humidity in my house is pretty low. But I tried putting neem oil on one of my pileas to see if it will do anything. They're also slowing losing leaves, not much yellowing. But on my propagated pilea, it's starting to lose leaves which is weird and the leaves are getting lighter.   


So I'm really just not sure what to do about. My pileas, which my favorite plant, always end up like this so idk if its something with my house.   


Pilea Details  
Humidity: Around 30%   
Area: New England  
Watering: I try to let it dry out, but sometimes I feel like I wait too long (usually around 1.5 weeks)   
Soil: I make a well-draining soil with cactus/palm potting soil, perlite, orchard bark, and some worm castings  
Light: Indirect I think, It's in my living room which gets the most light in my house bout usually on my table or back shelf which is about 6-10ft away from south-facing window.

Hence, I'm developing a smart planter (indoor plants) that focuses on furniture and design rather than just being a mere gadget. I'm planning on launching a Kickstarter Campaign this year to finance this endeavor. If you're interested or want to know more, you can view more Images on my Instagram @ Soilplanter. I would also love to have your feedback on the designs and if you have any questions I'll answer them ASAP.

First, i would like to mention that i am a novice when it comes to gardening and maintaining my plants so i may not be the best at describing what i mean so in advance i am sorry for any misunderstandings. Two weeks ago i have replanted the offsprings from my succulent (i unfortunately dont know what its called) because i wanted to gift them to my biology teacher so they can grow in the biology lab. As you can see on the photo the lower part of the stems turned this weird brownish orange colour. I would also like to mention that they were previously pure white. I consulted my teacher and she says that she did not overwater them. From my observations, the leaves didnt get soft, so i think that rotting is out of option but i dont know. Ive heard that in some case when their envoirment is changing they may produce caroten, and well the amount of sunlight has  changed. We will try to stop watering it for two weeks just in case to try it out, but as i said i dont really know whats happening to them and all i said before was only my observations and hypotheses. Sorry that my post is long to read, i didnt mean it. Any answers and tips are appreciated. Thanks for replies in advance",https://i.redd.it/x0usfcd6g3lc1.jpeg

I gave my partner this lemon plant roughly 7 months ago, and we have had some issues with it since. We are coming here to ask for your advice on how to tackle the problems and how to provide better care for the plant henceforth.  We have had the following problems:

1. Mold on the leaves and on the lemons themselves (just wash off with wet cloth?)
2. A white waxy layer on the leaves (which we read somewhere is normal for lemon plants)
3. A little spider set up its home and we were wondering if it should be released outside
4. Little flies in the soil 

For the flies we are now going to purchase some sand to cover the soil with and look to buy some strips to help get rid of them as they are terrorizing the entire house.

We would very much appreciate any tips for dealing with the above issues as well as general advice for caring for a lemon plant, i.e. how much and how often to water it, does it need any (and how much/frequent) extra nutrition, does it need any trimming of the leaves etc?

Many thanks in advance!

So, I’ve been wanting to grow a white balloon flower (Platycodon grandiflorus), SO BADLY, because they’re one of my absolute favorite plants. However, I’ve only ever seen the indigo variety anywhere near me, so if I want a white one, I have no choice but to buy the seeds online. 

Last spring, I purchased 3 packets of seeds from 3 separate online gardening sites (I can’t remember the name or anything, sorry), that the sellers claimed were balloon flower seeds, and worked very hard and very diligently to grow them. I’d never tried growing plants from seeds before, but I figured it would be pretty easy, since everyone says they’re an easy plant to grow, but none of the seeds would sprout. Then, when I finally got ONE single seed to sprout, it wasn’t a balloon flower at all! It was a weed, commonly called goosefoot. I was so heartbroken, I’d spent literal months working my ass off trying to get these seeds to sprout, and they weren’t even the right plant. 

I still really, really want to have a white balloon flower plant (specifically the single bloom variety, *not* the double bloom variety), because I absolutely of them and I’m just dying to have one of my very own, but I don’t know how to identify if a seller is trustworthy and reputable, and I can’t afford to waste the money on random trial and error. Can anyone help me? Advice on how to tell whether a seller is legit, or a place you yourself have bought plants from (assuming they sell white balloon flowers) of course, would mean the world to me.

I'm almost positive that my plant is a Monstera Adansonii (do you think so too?) and I received it as a single leaf last year and within the last 3 months it's grown 6 new leaves and almost 10 inches taller. 
I'm so happy with it. The only problem is that each leaf is bigger than the last and the vine at the top is much thicker than the base and it's so top heavy that without support it collapses. 

What should I do with it next? 
Should I keep it staked and just let it grow, or should I top it and try to propagate the top leaves?
Am I growing it all wrong?
